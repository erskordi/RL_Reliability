# Latent state estimation using Reinforcement Learning

The repo, when ready, will provide a process for estimating latent states using Reinforcement Learning and Variational Autoencoders, without the need of specifying parameterized state-space models. 

Soon, a yaml file of the Anaconda environment used will be posted here.
